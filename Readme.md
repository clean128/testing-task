## Problem

Implement one of the following API's in Node or Express. Let the Backend folder be separate from the Frontend. Use React for your frontend. Keep it very minimal (1-page) and sleek, focus more on the backend. Submit the code on a ZIP file by email, or a private Github repo. (Suggested Time: No more than 2 hours)

1. Any TikTok API of choice.
2. Pinterest Post API.
3. Deepseek API.
4. HuggingFace Inference API.

The content, structure, and database (if any) used is your choice.

You will be graded on:

1. Attention to Detail: Whether there are any bugs, unused buttons, or unnecessary file structures, and the smoothness in the function of the backend code.
2. User experience: How it feels navigating the app.
3. Code clarity: The code should be clean, lack redundancies, and readable.
4. Design and creativity: Animations, style, and design.
